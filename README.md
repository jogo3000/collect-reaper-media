Parser for Reaper project files

# Rationale
Reaper is my favourite DAW. Sometimes the user interface trips me and
I end up making edits that I regret. A lot of them. In these cases
sometimes I've written tools for automatically correct the mistakes I
made. Sometimes it's easy, sometimes it's not. The RPP file format
used by Reaper is not too easy to parse and process, as it is "almost
XML" but not quite.

Therefore, I decided to write a parser which I can use to help create my
Reaper project cleaning tools.
