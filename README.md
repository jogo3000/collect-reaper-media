# collect-reaper-media
Tool for collecting all the media in a Reaper project in a single place

# Rationale
Reaper is my favourite DAW. It has a single flaw though, and that is when you import media files to a project. You can end up with a reaper project with media files all over your disk. Not portable! With this tool, you can take a Reaper project and collect all of the media under one directory.
